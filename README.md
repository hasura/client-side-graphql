# GraphQL without a server

## TL;DR

- You do not need a GraphQL server to use the GraphQL APIs on the client. ([Example](https://github.com/hasura/client-side-graphql/tree/master/examples/graphql-wrapper-rest))
- You do not need a separate GraphQL server to stitch the schemas of two existing GraphQL APIs. ([Example](https://github.com/hasura/client-side-graphql/tree/master/examples/schema-stitching))

## Introduction

GraphQL is essentially a syntax that describes how to ask for data. A GraphQL API is something that accepts queries in GraphQL syntax and resolves them to whatever is asked by a query. Traditionally, this are written on a server and exposed on a single endpoint. However, since the growth of [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/client/), and the tools around it, this GraphQL wrapper can be written on the client as well.

## Examples

### Simple GraphQL schema

This example makes a simple hello-world GraphQL schema.

```js
import { makeExecutableSchema } from 'graphql-tools';
import { SchemaLink } from 'apollo-link-schema';
import { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory';
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-client';

const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    message: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    message: (root, args, context, info) => "hello-world"
  }
};

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: new SchemaLink({ schema }),
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
})

// You can use this client in your app and it will work like any other GraphQL server

```

Check out [this example](https://github.com/hasura/client-side-graphql/tree/master/examples/graphql-wrapper-rest) where we have written a GraphQL wrapper over the [Meta weather REST API](https://www.metaweather.com/).

### Schema Stitching

This is an example of stitching two remote GraphQL schemas.

```js
import { makeRemoteExecutableSchema, introspectSchema, mergeSchemas } from 'graphql-tools';
import { SchemaLink } from 'apollo-link-schema';
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-client';

const uri1 = 'https://server1.com/graphql';
const uri2 = 'https://server2.com/graphql';

const getRemoteExecutableSchema = async (uri) => {
  const httpLink = new HttpLink({ uri });
  const remoteSchema = await introspectSchema(httpLink);
  return makeRemoteExecutableSchema({ schema: remoteSchema, link: httpLink });
}

const executableSchema1 = await getRemoteExecutableSchema(uri1);
const executableSchema2 = await getRemoteExecutableSchema(uri2);

const newSchema = mergeSchemas({
  schemas: [
    executableSchema1,
    executableSchema2
  ]
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: new SchemaLink({ schema: newSchema }),
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});

// You can use this client in your app and it will work like any other GraphQL server
```

You can also have custom resolvers if you want to link your schemas in some way. You just have to add them to the resolvers field in the `mergeSchemas` function.

```js

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    ...
  },
  Mutation: {
    ...
  }
}

const newSchema = mergeSchemas({
  schemas: [
    executableSchema1,
    executableSchema2
  ],
  resolvers: resolvers
});
```

Check out [this example](https://github.com/hasura/client-side-graphql/tree/master/examples/schema-stitching) where we stitch a remote GraphQL schema with a local GraphQL schema.
